**Exploring interactive visuals and generative art through `p5.js`.** <br>
This repository showcases two projects developed for the Content Prototyping course, demonstrating real-time audio visualization and algorithmic composition.

## 🟡 1. Pacman Audio Visualizer 🎵  
**An interactive Pac-Man animation that reacts to audio input.**  
- Audio-driven animation where Pac-Man figures react dynamically to music.
- Changes in size, speed, direction, and color based on sound amplitude.
- Explores music visualization and generative motion graphics.
- Built with p5.js, showcasing real-time interaction between sound and visuals.
